# Discrete-Gradient-Generator
It makes a discrete gradient of a given size and mixing
Java, run on Processing.

Size and mixing are given by _length, _width, and _s in the constants section and must be changed manually.
_s in particular might need to be quite large, and getting a good result can be a bit finicky.
